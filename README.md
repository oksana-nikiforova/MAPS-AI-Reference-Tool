# MAPS-AI-Reference-Tool
MAPS-AI is a research prototype for model-driven and AI-assisted generation of IT project initiation artefacts. It transforms business process models into structured, traceable outputs such as UML use case diagrams, agile backlogs, scope statements, and IT Project Management Plans using deterministic transformations and controlled AI enrichment.
